# SAP-MM-LOGISTICS-VERIFICATION-MODULE

Introduction : 

SAP MM stands for Material Management. The SAP MM (Materials Management) Logistics Verification module is essential for the purpose of overseeing the verification procedures connected to inventory and procurement management. Before products and services are accepted into inventory, it entails verifying and validating their receipt and making sure they adhere to the necessary criteria. The logistics verification procedure makes sure that the products delivered and services obtained match the quantity and quality requirements specified in the purchase order. This module connects with other modules including Finance (FI) and Sales and Distribution (SD) and is a part of SAP's larger Materials Management (MM) module.
